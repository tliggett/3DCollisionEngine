# 3DCollisionEngine
This paper reviews the process I followed while implementing 3-Dimensional Collision 
Physics into computer code using the Java programming language. In this paper I have broken 
this process down into an introduction and the four phases of the computer program I created. 
These phases examine the physics and coding of collisions, as well as the problems I 
encountered along the way. Coding collisions is one of the hardest subjects I have delved into in 
high school, as all collisions must be calculated with no knowledge of any post-collision 
statistics. While the concepts I learned in AP Physics gave me the foundation to my 
understanding of these concepts, the collision formulas I learned were rendered useless, and I 
was forced to find answers elsewhere. This paper will describe these answers. 

My coding is done in the Processing Developing Environment, created by Ben Fry and 
Casey Reas. Processing libraries make animation easier and I would strongly recommend similar 
libraries when working with advanced physics. Most of the physics used came from 
EuclideanSpace.com, a website developed by Martin John Baker devoted to Mathematics and 
Computing. Other works used are listed in the bibliography at the end of the paper.
